# One-Day-Challenge-1-
A game coded in a single day.
How to play : 
You are a bird and the aim is to avoid the flying blocks as long as possible.
Over time the blocks will spawn more frequently.
To restart the game press '1'.
To quit the game press 'Esc'.
Because of the nature of the SFML Framework, on some computers the fullscreen mode might not render properly. My apologies if you happen to encounter it.
